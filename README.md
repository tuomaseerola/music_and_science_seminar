## Music and Science Seminar materials

[Tuomas Eerola](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/tuomas-eerola/), Durham University, Music Department, 2022.

These Jupyter notebooks have been developed for **Music and Science Module** (UG MUSI2731 for 2022-2-23). They are designed to work within Colab (Python 3.7 with Librosa 0.8.1 and matplotlib).

The links will take you to Colab pages.
